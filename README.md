This report presents an overview of the Mechatronics System Integration (MCTA3203) module, which emphasizes the practical integration of hardware and software components in modern mechatronic systems. The module provides hands-on experience in combining microcontrollers (Arduino), computers (Raspberry Pi), sensors, and actuators, using various communication and control techniques such as the Modbus RTU protocol over USB. Through twelve comprehensive topics, students gain the essential skills required to design, interface, and implement real-time control systems.

The topics covered in this module include: Digital Logic Systems, Serial Communication (Servomotor), Designing a Motion-Activated RFID System, Controlling a DC Motor Using L298P Motor Driver Shield and GPIO, Smart Surveillance System Using ESP32-CAM, Interfacing a PLC with a Microcontroller and a PC over Ethernet/IP, Remote Temperature Monitoring and Control via Bluetooth, Image/Video Input Interfacing with a Microcontroller, Signal Filtering and Real-Time Control using Arduino and DSP Principles, Distance-Triggered Door Automation using TF-Luna ToF LiDAR Sensor, and Exploring Software and Hardware Considerations when Interfacing with Embedded Systems.

Overall, this module bridges theoretical knowledge and practical application, enabling students to develop integrated mechatronic systems that demonstrate effective communication, control, and automation in real-world engineering environments.
